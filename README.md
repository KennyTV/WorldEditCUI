Sassy Minecraft plugin to show your current WorldEdit selection by displaying particles (which can be greatly customized in the plugin's config).
It aims at a higher performance and lesser memory impact by having a quite simplistic approach to calculating vectors.

You can read up on everything else and see examples on the [**Spigot page**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldeditsui.60726/).

## Compiling
Sorry, it uses a custom dependency that currently doesn't sit anywhere but on my computer :>
